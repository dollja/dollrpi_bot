The bot can list names and information about RPI Alumni who have been inducted into the Hall of Fame when you enter a question about an induction year. 
Right now, it covers years 2013-2020. It works out misunderstandings like:

	Human: I don't know what questions to ask.
	Bot: Would you like to know more about RPI’S recent Hall of Fame inductees?
	Human: No.
	Bot: Really? I don’t have anything else to chat about. 

And responds with acknowledgments and confirmations.

	Human: Is 2013 an induction year? 
	Bot: Yes, <star/> is a year in which several alumni members were inducted into the Hall of Fame.

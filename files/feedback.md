# Users' Feedback
--------
Qualitative feedback from 2 users’ who tested the dolljrpi bot was collected in post-test interviews. Their responses showed confusion over the general purpose of the bot. No greeting or instruction was provided at the start except for 'Please enter a message'. This ambiguity seemed to negatively effect any conversational flow which might have emerged. Overall clarity was an issue, causing delays and hesitations, slowing the speed at which users responded to each reply. Only some of the bot's messages turned out meaningful and correct in the right context. Without major adjustments and additions to the dialog, using the FAQ bot will be akward and mostly inaccurate. 

Users were not sure where to begin or what to use the bot for: “It didn't make sense. I could tell it was for RPI's Alummi Hall of Fame because of the description.”

[The main Greeting is the part that could be fixed]: “The start. Not knowing what I'm using it for. I don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere.”
